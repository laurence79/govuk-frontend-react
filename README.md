# govuk-frontend-react-ts

A thin shim of React and Typescript on top of [govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend).

## Installation

```sh
npm i govuk-frontend-react-ts
```

Also add the peer dependencies if not already installed

```sh
npm i govuk-frontend react react-dom
```

## Usage

Make sure you import the styles somewhere global

```scss
@import '~govuk-frontend-react-ts/dist/index';
```

Then import components like so

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Tag } from 'govuk-frontend-react-ts';

export const MyStuff: React.FC<{}> => (
  <Tag colour="red" />
);
```

## Development

### Testing

```
npm run cypress:run
```

### Building

```
npm run build
```

### Storybook

To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
npm run storybook
```

### Generating New Components

```
npm run generate YourComponentName
```

This will generate:

```
/src
  /components
    /YourComponentName
      YourComponentName.tsx
      YourComponentName.stories.tsx
      YourComponentName.test.tsx
      YourComponentName.types.ts
      YourComponentName.scss
      index.ts
```

The default templates for each file can be modified under `util/templates`.

Don't forget to add the component to your `index.ts` exports if you want the library to export the component!

### Installing Component Library Locally

Let's say you have another project (`test-app`) on your machine that you want to try installing the component library into without having to first publish the component library. In the `test-app` directory, you can run:

```
npm i --save ../govuk-frontend-react-ts
```

which will install the local component library as a dependency in `test-app`. It'll then appear as a dependency in `package.json` like:

```JSON
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "govuk-frontend-react-ts": "file:../govuk-frontend-react-ts",
    ...
  },
  ...
```

Your components can then be imported and used in that project.

### Guidelines

- Steer as close to the original govuk-frontend component as possible, but feel
  free to design a more react-like interface.

- Any components which involve routing should not directly reference a routing
  library. This is so we can support both
  [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) and
  [next.js](https://nextjs.org)
